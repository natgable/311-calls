Overview
--------

The goal of the Data Challenge Lab is to help you develop
professional-level skills. C01 is a quarter-long project in which you
will develop these skills by doing the work of a data scientist. In C01,
you will:

-   Choose a topic that interests you.
-   Obtain the necessary data and wrangle it for analysis.
-   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on your data, asking and
    answering questions and gaining insights.
-   Present your findings to your peers.

You will likely learn new skills, or deepen existing ones, by working on
your C01. To help your teammates learn from what you learn, you will
also:

-   Turn an aspect of your project into an educational challenge that
    others on the team will complete.

You can use your C01 as an opportunity to explore a topic that interests
you or to develop mastery in an area beyond what we cover in the rest of
the class.

Your C01 **does not** need to be original work. We encourage you to
start by recreating the work of other data scientists. For example, you
might find an interesting analysis and visualization and recreate both
from the original raw data. Once you’re familiar with the data and can
recreate the past work, you can go further than the original data
scientists by asking new questions and seeking additional insights.

You will meet with Bill regularly over the course of the quarter to
discuss your progress.

### eda folder

The eda folder is for your exploratory data analysis work. Use R
Markdown files within this folder to record your progress as a scientist
would in a log book: what works, what doesn’t work, insights gained, new
directions to explore. You will later draw upon these files to create
your progress reports, your challenge for the rest of the team, and your
final report. Use the README.md file in this folder to explain the
organization of your files.

### team-challenge folder

The team-challenge folder is where to put your challenge for the rest of
the team and the solution. The folder contains a template master.Rmd
file that can be used to automatically generate challenge.Rmd and
solution.Rmd files, as well as answers.

### step\_\* files

The step\_\* files are to complete, knit, and upload for the C01 step
milestones.

Step 1: Project proposal 1
--------------------------

Deadlines:

-   Sun, Jan 13, 11:59 PM: Upload
-   Fri, Jan 18, 6:30 PM: Confer with Bill

The first step of the project is to explore different possibilities for
your own challenge. Your challenge should be something that:

-   You find interesting.
-   Has an aspect that can be turned into a challenge that others would
    find interesting.
-   Uses data that is either publicly available or that Stanford has a
    license for.

Your project can be your own idea, or you can choose from the wide
variety of

-   [C01 challenge ideas](https://goo.gl/gupZna)

we have collected from a variety of domains.

For the Step 1 milestone, you can have more than one idea for your
project. For each idea, write up a brief description that contains:

-   An overview of the project, the data, and the goals.
-   Links to the data, or an explanation of how you will obtain the
    data.
-   Links to the work of the original data scientists, if you are doing
    a re-creation.

To submit your project proposal, simply complete, knit, and upload the
step\_1\_project\_proposal\_1.Rmd file in this folder

Step 2: Project proposal 2
--------------------------

Deadlines:

-   Sun, Jan 20, 11:59 PM: Upload
-   Fri, Jan 25, 6:30 PM: Confer with Bill

Using feedback on project proposal 1 and further work, create your
project proposal 2. For your project idea, write up a brief description
that contains:

-   An overview of the project, the data, and the goals.
-   Links to the data, or an explanation of how you will obtain the
    data.
-   If a re-creation of the work of other data scientists, links to
    their work.
-   The aspect that can be turned into a challenge for the rest of the
    team.
-   A decomposition of the project into smaller parts with goals for the
    milestones:
    -   Progress report 1 (week 4)
    -   Progress report 2 (week 6)
    -   Challenge for rest of the team (week 7)
    -   Final report (week 9)

To submit your project proposal, simply complete, knit, and upload the
step\_2\_project\_proposal\_2.Rmd file in this folder
